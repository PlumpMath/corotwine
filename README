COROTWINE
---------

Corotwine is an interface to various Twisted APIs using coroutines.

Currently this support is limited to Greenlet (py.magic.greenlet).

Dependencies:

 * Twisted >= 8.1 (Ubuntu 'python-twisted', http://twistedmatrix.com/)
 * Py Lib (Ubuntu 'python-codespeak-lib', http://codespeak.net/py/)


LEARNING
--------

There are examples in corotwine/examples.py.

There is API documentation at
http://twistedmatrix.com/users/radix/corotwine/api/

Currently there are three interesting systems:

 * Protocol support at corotwine.protocol. Write TCP servers and clients.
 * Deferred support at corotwine.defer. Integrate with Deferred-using code
   in both directions.
 * Time support at corotwine.clock.
